# Speaker-Invariant Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks

Source codes for our ICMI'20 paper: Speaker-Invariant Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Emotion Recognition

## Source Listing
### experiment_a and experiment_v
Source codes of detecting arousal and valence values. Implemented models include baseline, domain-adversarial neural networks (DANN), and speaker-invariant DANN (SIDANN)
### preprocess_iemocap and preprocess_msp_improv
Feature extraction codes for the two datasets.
